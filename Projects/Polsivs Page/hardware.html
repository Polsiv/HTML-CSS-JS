                <p class="parr"> So after around 2 years I finally was able to afford my own setup, it was such a good experience. Keep in mind I gave 75% of the budget, my dad gave me the other 25%, but hey, it's a win still. I built by my on the pc and it was for real tedious but funny at the same time, also for the storage I bought 240GB SSD kingston, I dont have any picture at the moment, but it's not that relevant to take care of.
